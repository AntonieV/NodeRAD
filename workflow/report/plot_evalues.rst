The **E-values plot** shows the expectation values from the blast analysis of loci identified by NodeRAD versus the loci known from the simulation.
The `E-value <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html>`_ indicates the likelihood that a given sequence match is random.
The lower the E value, the more significant the score and the alignment.
