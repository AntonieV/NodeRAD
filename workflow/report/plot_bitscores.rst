The **Bit score plot** shows the expectation values from the blast analysis of loci identified by NodeRAD versus the loci known from the simulation.
The `bit score <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html>`_ is log2 scaled and indicates the size of a sequence database that would be required to find the current match by chance.
The higher the bit score, the more significant the match.
